# chimney
[WIP] Technologically a playground to test if it is possible to write a meaningful app using just Android Architecture Components where available, Chimney will help you to select a random game from your Steam library based on different criteria.

## State

This app is in a very early development stage. You can't do any meaningful with it, but I use it as a playground to experiment with
Android architecture components, mainly Lifecycle Aware Components, LiveData and Room.
